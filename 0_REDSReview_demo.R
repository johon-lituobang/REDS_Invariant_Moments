#you can simulate a distribution with any sample sizeã€‚

#SWA function will return all six SWAs with breakdown point 1/8 plus mean and median.

#since 5207 is not a multiple of 8, there are two solutions
5207%%8

#one is randomly sampling a smaller sample that is a multiple of 8
#set the rand=TRUE, the blocknumber=1/percentage.
SWA(x,percentage=1/32,blocknumber=32,batch="auto",sorted=FALSE,rand=TRUE)

#another solution is forming an additional block, the middle block, that take the reminder into account.
SWA(x,percentage=1/8,blocknumber=9,batch="auto",sorted=FALSE,rand=FALSE)

#the first approach is used here, since it is accurate.

#median Hodges-Lehmann mean using the quasi-bootstrap

#you should ensure that the sample you provided have kurtosis smaller than 26, this is the current limit, but will improved soon.

#finally, median standardized moments are also provided, that is very helpful for studying distributions with infinite moments.

x<-rPareto(5184,shape=1, scale=1)

#warning message will return, since the kurtosis is larger than 26.
#this is in fact based on the d values of Weibull distribution with kurtosis 26 and skewness 3.68, so the values will be 
#always close to this combination.

#the number in front of the warning message is the number of that message repeated.

#so median standardized moments are better choices.
medianstandardizedmoments(x)
#sample moments are invalid.

#if the sample size is smaller than 4096, warning message will also return
#the finite sample bias hasn't not been integrated into this package yet. Will update later.

#even for the kurtosis, the bias is relatively small

#in fact, this can be further improved, but due to the length limit, this is all at this stage.

#related statistical tests will update later.
