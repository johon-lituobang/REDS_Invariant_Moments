# Robust estimations from distribution structures: Invariant moments.

I am introducing this work in YouTube, if you are interested, please visit: https://www.youtube.com/@Iobiomathematics. These works have been publically deposited in this Github since one year ago (I hidden some previous versions after updated new versions). Also, it has been deposited in Zenodo Tuobang Li. (2022). Robust estimations for semiparametric models: Moments. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8127703
